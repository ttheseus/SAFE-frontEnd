<!--

CURRENTLY:
    - The code will take in user inputs and CREATE a JSON file in the correct format

    - Most HTML is dynamically generated in the renderer.js file

    - BUGS:
        - After dynamically generating the zone code for camera 1, it stays on all 
            screens for camera 2 (doesn't affect anything but it's just annoying)

        - If the user doesn't input a value for the camera number, the error that pops 
            up won't allow them to continue trying to input a value

        - Clicking on the generate zones 'next' button will continuously generate more
             code - Try to make it so that if the user inputs another value and 
             generates, it overrides what it has right now


FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:
    - Streamline code better for easier css formatting (a lot of unnecessary containers 
        may create confusion)

    - After user submits, make a page that allows them to either quit the application or
        go back to the beginning

    - This code if the FIRST option of TWO the user should get. The second option should 
        be to upload/pull data from the SAFE program and edit it

    - Better GFX

    - Optimize code so that the application is under 0.5GB

    - Try to make each page a new HTMl file for 
        a) easier editing
        b) less funky sidebar code

                        This app will allow you to quickly generate the input JSON file for your SAFE program.
                        Please enter what the application prompts into the input boxes. Once you have finished,
                        you may click the submit button and the file will be downloaded to your downloads folder.
                    </p>
                    <p>After that, simply drag the file into the folder labelled 'data' in your SAFE program
                        directory ('Merge') and you are done.
