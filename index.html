<!--

CURRENTLY:
    - The code gives the user two options, 1) create a new JSON file and 2) edit an uploaded
    JSON file.

    - Most HTML is dynamically generated in the renderer.js file

    - BUGS:
        - After dynamically generating the zone code for camera 1, it stays on all 
            screens for camera 2 (doesn't affect anything but it's just annoying) (FIXED)

        - If the user doesn't input a value for the camera number, the error that pops 
            up won't allow them to continue trying to input a value (FIXED)

        - Clicking on the generate zones 'next' button will continuously generate more
             code - Try to make it so that if the user inputs another value and 
             generates, it overrides what it has right now (FIXED)


FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:
    - After user submits, make a page that allows them to either quit the application or
        go back to the beginning

    - Optimize code so that the application is under 0.5GB
